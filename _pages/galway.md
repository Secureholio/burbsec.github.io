Burbsec Galway is an informal meetup of Information Security enthusiasts,
engineers, coders, hackers, geeks, and anyone interested in being more 
secure! Each month brings new discussions & maybe even some learning. 
We're still small but growing, with people from all walks of life or even
full-time security people! We have NO DUES and NO PUSHY SALESPEOPLE! Some
times we'll have a short presentation if someone is willing to share 
knowledge! Afterwards we may have a discussion on what was put together.

We've moved into Galway City proper! Based on everyone's ability to attend
we're now at Murty Rabbit's on the last Sunday of the month. See ya there!
